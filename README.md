# lxc-expose-port

lxc-expose-port is a simple script that sets up port forwarding for LXC
containers. It was influenced by https://github.com/evanhempel/lxc-portforward
but is not a fork of that project.

Unlike lxc-portforward, lxc-expose-port correctly handles connections to the
external port from the host itself and from other containers. Also, it does
not need any extra configuration file.

The script, as it is, works on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 only. To support other
systems, replace this line

    . /etc/default/lxc-net

with a line that sets $LXC_NETWORK to the network used by LXC containers, in
CIDR notation (e.g., to 10.0.3.0/34).

The use of Ubuntu 14.04 is supported only with the updated kernel. The reason
is that kernels before 3.19 refused to send a DNATed packet back to the bridge
port it originated from, thus breaking container communication with itself.

# Basic usage

Copy lxc-expose-port to /etc/lxc. Then, in your container config, add
something like this:

    # for LXC 1.x:
    lxc.network.script.up = /etc/lxc/lxc-expose-port 8080:80 2222:22 udp/9999:9999
    lxc.network.script.down = /etc/lxc/lxc-expose-port

    # for LXC 2.x and 3.x:
    lxc.net.0.script.up = /etc/lxc/lxc-expose-port 8080:80 2222:22 udp/9999:9999
    lxc.net.0.script.down = /etc/lxc/lxc-expose-port

The example above will cause the host's TCP ports 8080 and 2222 to be
forwarded to ports 80 and 22 of the container, and will also forward UDP port
9999 to port 9999 of the container.

# Usage with LXC Web Panel

LXC Web Panel (https://github.com/claudyus/LXC-Web-Panel) is a convenient tool
for managing LXC containers with a web browser. Unfortunately, it does not
allow spaces and colons in lxc.network.script.up. The problem is merely due to
a too-strict validation rule, and can be fixed. Edit lwp/utils.py and change
this line:

    file_match = '^\/\w[\w.\/-]+$'

to this:

    file_match = '^\/\w[\w.\/: -]+$'

and then restart lwp.

Note: LXC Web Panel is not really compatible with LXC later than 1.x.
